THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCES

  1. Core Audeinces - Target ads using FB data
  2. Custom audiences - Use data from your CMS, website, mobile app, or other sources to target Facebook ads to people you already know.
  3. Lookalike audiences - Surface new audiences by combining Custom Audiences with Facebook targeting.

ELEMENTS OF A CORE AUDIENCE

  The default Facebook ad targeting option is Core Audiences. Targeting happens at the ad set level, and audiences can be broken out into separate ad sets when you’d bid differently to reach each audience.

  Building a Core Audience on Facebook lets marketers calibrate ad delivery around demographics, locations, interests, behaviors, and connections.

  When building Core Audiences, you can opt to include or exclude people from your target audience based on any of these attributes listed below. You can save Core Audiences for future use, and can modify Saved Audiences to test and optimize your targeting.
  
  Demographic targeting draws from information that people share publicly on Facebook about their education, political views, family/relationship status, life events, career, and more.

  Location targeting allows marketers to target ads by postal code, city, region, or country — or worldwide — and to deliver ads based on where people are, whether they live in a location, are new arrivals, or just visiting.

  Interest targeting focuses on consumer and lifestyle categories such as fitness, fashion, or hobbies.

  Connections targeting is based on audience engagement with your Facebook Page, Facebook Events, or app.
